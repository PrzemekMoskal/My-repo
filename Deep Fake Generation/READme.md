## Introduction

This project focuses on the generation of deepfakes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Deepfakes refer to synthetic media where a person's likeness is replaced with someone else's, typically for entertainment or artistic purposes. This project implements a GAN model to create realistic facial images.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deepfake-Generation-Using-GAN.git
   cd Deepfake-Generation-Using-GAN
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**


python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install the required dependencies:**


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
### Data Preprocessing

### Training the Model

### Generating Deepfakes

### Results 
They are present in the notebook in terms of losses and accuracies.
For the real deepfakes,you can get them after you run the notebook with your dataset.
