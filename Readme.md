## About Face-x 
<img src="https://github.com/Vi1234sh12/Face-X/blob/master/.github/Assests/537-5375273_teamwork-isometric-illustration-clipart-removebg-preview.png"  height="500px" align="right"/>
Face-x is a face detection and recognition GitHub project

Our approach to face detection and recognition is based on FaceNet and InsightFace libraries that use deep neural networks. Face-x  provides a convenient REST API for training algorithms to detect and recognize faces from your collection of images (aka Face Collection). The solution also features a role management system that allows you to easily control who has access to your Face Collection.here are several approaches for an algorithm to recognize a face. An algorithm can make use of statistics, try to find a pattern which represents a specific person or use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates all kinds of algorithms and various operations that can be implemented on a frontal face. The available algorithms process only high-resolution static shots and perform sufficiently well.


##  Demonstration of different algorithms and operations on faces

<a href="https://github.com/akshitagupta15june/Face-X/tree/master/Recognition-Algorithms">Recognition</a>  of faces by different algorithms and frameworks. Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made solution to implement. So In this project all kind of algorithms are implemented and even with various operations that can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only high-resolution static shots and performed insufficiently.

Filters, or added effects, can be applied over images in a variety of ways before being uploaded to one‚Äôs social network for others to see. Geofilters allow users to alter a picture of a landscape, such as adding color to sky or turning day to night

The app can be connected to any existing or new IP mask detection cameras to detect people without a mask. App users can also add faces and phone numbers to send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, a notification can be sent out to the administrator.
