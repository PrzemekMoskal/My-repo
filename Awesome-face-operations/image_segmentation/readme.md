<h1> Image Segmentation Using Color space and Opencv</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments is defined as image segmentation. Segmentation aims to divide an image into regions that can be more representative and easier to analyze. Such regions may correspond to individual surfaces, objects, or natural parts of objects. Typically image segmentation is the process used to locate objects and boundaries (e.g., lines or curves) in images . Furthermore, it can be defined as the process of labeling every pixel in an image, where all pixels having the same label share certain visual characteristics </p>
