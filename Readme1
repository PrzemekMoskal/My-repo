# Introduction:-
     Face mask detection had seen significant progress in the domains of Image processing and Computer vision, since the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
     Many face detection models have been created using several algorithms and  techniques.  
     The approach in this project uses deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to detect face masks.
     Convolutional Neural Network, Data augmentation are the key to this project.

Concept :- 
# Open CV
       OpenCV uses machine learning algorithms to search for faces within a picture.
       OpenCV is the most popular library for computer vision. Originally written in C/C++, it now provides  bindings for Python.

     After Installing OpenCV
         Some useful Command
           > import cv2
          > # Read the image
               image = cv2.imread(imagePath)
               gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        > # Detect faces in the image
              faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(
              gray,
              scaleFactor=1.1,
              minNeighbors=5,
              minSize=(30, 30),
              flags = cv2.cv.CV_HAAR_SCALE_IMAGE)
 # Deep Learning 
 Face detection is a problem in computer vision of locating and localizing one or more faces in a photograph.

 Face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society purpose using some basic Machine Learning
 packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn. 
 The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not. 

 Incorporated Packages
 TensorFlow :- 
   TensorFlow, an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, 
   is utilized for implementing ML systems into fabrication over a bunch of areas
   of computer science, including sentiment analysis, voice recognition, geographic information extraction, 
   computer vision, text summarization, information retrieval, computational drug discovery and flaw detection to pursue research.
   In the proposed model, the whole Sequential CNN architecture (consists of several layers) uses TensorFlow at backend. 
   It is also used to reshape the data (image) in the data processing.

 Keras:- 
  Keras gives fundamental reflections and building units for creation and transportation of ML arrangements with high iteration velocity.
  It takes full advantage of the scalability and cross-platform capabilities of TensorFlow.
  The core data structures of Keras are layers and models [19]. All the layers used in the CNN model are implemented using Keras.
  Along with the conversion of the class vector to the binary class matrix in data processing, it helps to compile the overall model.
